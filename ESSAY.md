Why technologies like self-driving and job automation will push more importance to online presence & advertising in the digital space


Technologies like self-driving and job automation will not only help relieve many bottlenecks in the economy like supply chain and labor market, but it will also be one of the greatest inventions next to electricity mankind has ever experienced. Self Driving will take the transportation industry by storm. The Transportation Department has already approved it to be legal on roadways. It is only a matter of time before millions of truck driver jobs will be replaced by an automated driving machine, which will lower the cost of freight and have a deflationary effect. Job automation, which is a broader category which encompasses self-driving, will also continue to improve as well. Of the 9 million unfilled jobs in our country, you can expect the majority of them to be filled by a lifeless machine less than 10 years from today.

	That is, because most of them are “low-skilled, low-wage jobs”. No one wants to work them because the benefits are so low. Thus, they go unfilled. They will be filled by computers and robots who can count change, vend products, and do mundane tasks at an unprecedented rate. This will leave a number of people who filled otherwise traditional (and outdated) jobs in our economy looking for work. One place where everyone is already present is online. More and more people will join the online industry as e-commerce, delivery, and advertising overwhelm businesses and automation really takes affect in the economy overall. Contrary to belief, this transitionary shift will increase GDP, travel, and spending. The displaced people will have to find some job in the growing online economy because it is the only place left to experience growth and new job fields. Even booming sectors like healthcare will slow down eventually because we have a slowing population growth.

	The online E-Commerce business is one of the most rapidly evolving up and coming businesses in the online ecospace. With the rise of popular social media, and as an overall entertainment place, the Internet has brought along with it ways of doing daily tasks like keeping a schedule or doing your shopping from home. It has also brought about Quick Meetings, Reminders, and other things that help our daily activities go along as planned. One of the super important parts of this is the things we need and use daily can be automated to be delivered directly to your residence, subtracting the need for transportation away from your Home, Workplace, Business Office, etc. As a result, there is a huge competitive market among E-Commerce companies who create goods for market share. Companies now need to compete with competitors in a relatively new way, acquiring, obtaining and retaining customers through a digital atmosphere through innovative things like new Mobile Apps, Social Media, and other digitized assets like NFC technology for order pickup and arrival.

	The opening of the Digital Economy will be led by sectors like Cloud Computing, which powerhouses the majority of mobile apps that the main congregation sites of Web Media take hold. Think YouTube, Amazon, and TikTok. There are many newly developed technologies which play an important part in how our economy functions as a whole. Individually, each one of these companies operate as an operator to the Privacy Amendment in the Constitution which goes to speak about Privacy and many other key important topics as well. Since 2016, the Tech War has placed a major boom or bust on companies from United States and China to develop more technology in an ever increasing arms race. Ultimately, both countries have worked towards key partnerships and agreements for industrial improvement and notable key supply chain issues have been brought forward by both parties as well.

	Artificial Intelligence will be the number one spot for people that are making startups more attractable from a free cash flow yield and revenue standpoint. Now, developer nomads are able to deploy key software implementations remotely via renting a cloud server. Sometimes the infrastructures of these critical parts of our newly developed supply chain (think assets in digital space) and how secure they are able to be. Things created from this standpoint to things like 3d files, and other industry-leading scripting frameworks will hold notoriety for several of different reasons. Most importantly, the mere result from creating something online with an imperialistic energy towards creating the most resilient new form of energy possible: digital media.

	There are many moving parts to how digital media and it’s underworking combine to create what is our modern day infrastructure of how the most important task-tracking, edit-checking, and problem fixing skills have to do for day-to-day agendas such as maintaining company digital media and other forms of assets that require general preemptive upkeep, development and security. The jobs that are replaced by artificial intelligence will have these as the minimal requirement. The more advanced new jobs will be learning how to develop algorithms, display them as being appealing to the client, and hosting them securely and remotely.

	Although our digital economy will far surpass any other working part of our economy, and millions (and maybe billions) of jobs will be forever changed and will continue to be changed by technology, we must all continue to work together for the betterment and advancement of mankind and overall wellness. If this does not persist, then humanity as a whole will begin to rollover and the algorithms and technologies we have built to deploy will suddenly become useless. Machines of war, behavior-controlling algorithms like social media, and other evil forces could take hold over good. We must all work together to make sure this does not happen and that the technology we create will have a meaningful long-lasting impact for us all.
